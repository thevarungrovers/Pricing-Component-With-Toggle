## My process

Initially, I created this project with mobile-first version using Bootstrap and  added the required things from the given information according to the need like changing the price of plans with the click of toogle button. Then, in the desktop version simple css is used to complete the challenge. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I mostly use this as it enables me to create different things in an easy way.
- [Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) -  I create Box Shadow using this shadow by just increasing or decreasing the range input and make shadows  according to my wish.
